<h1>January 2014 Wordpress Theme</h1>

<p><img src="http://xaviesteve.com/wp-content/themes/jan14/screenshot.png" alt=""></p>

<p>January 2014 is a flat, one column, minimal and modern Wordpress theme originally made for XaviEsteve.com. The theme focuses on great design, usability, readability, speed and concise code.</p>

<p>Don't use yet, I haven't tested anything and still need to fix the navigation menus, fix a few critical bugs and publish the documentation.</p>

<p>Docs here soon: http://xaviesteve.com/4575/</p>
