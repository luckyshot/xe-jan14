<h1>January 2014 Wordpress Theme <small>by Xavi Esteve</small></h1>

<p>January 2014 is a flat, one column, minimal and modern Wordpress theme originally made for XaviEsteve.com. The theme focuses on great design, usability, readability, speed and concise code.</p>

<p>Don't use yet, I haven't tested anything yet and still need to fix the navigation menus and publish the documentation</p>

<p>Docs here soon: http://xaviesteve.com/4575/</p>
